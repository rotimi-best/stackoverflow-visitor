# stackoverflow-visitor
I want to get the Fanatic badge on stackoverflow which requires to visit the site each day for 100 consecutive days, but most times I forget and I begin all over again from 0, so I decided to write a script that helps me get this badge. Its a cron job that visits stackoverflow daily.
